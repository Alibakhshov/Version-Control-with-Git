As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it.</p>"

    "    <p>A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. It is an essential feature available in most modern version control systems. A Git project can have more than one branch. We can perform many operations on Git branch-like rename, list, delete, etc.</p>\n",
    "    <li><strong><a href = \"https://www.javatpoint.com/git-checkout\">Checkout</a></strong></li>\n",
    "    <p>In Git, the term checkout is used for the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The <b>git checkout</b> command is used to switch between branches in a repository.<p>\n",
    "    <li><strong><a href = \"https://www.javatpoint.com/git-cherry-pick\">Cherry-Picking</a></strong></li>\n",
    "    <p>Cherry-picking in Git is meant to apply some commit from one branch into another branch. In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. You can revert the commit and cherry-pick it on another branch.<p>\n",
    "    <li><strong><a href = \"https://www.javatpoint.com/git-clone\">Clone</a></strong></li>\n",
    "    <p>The <b>git clone</b> is a Git command-line utility. It is used to make a copy of the target repository or clone it. If I want a local copy of my repository from GitHub, this tool allows creating a local copy of that repository on your local directory from the repository URL.<p>\n",

    "    <p>HEAD is the representation of the last commit in the current checkout branch. We can think of the head like a current branch. When you switch branches with git checkout, the HEAD revision changes, and points the new branch.<p>\n",

    "    <p>Master is a naming convention for Git branch. It's a default branch of Git. After cloning a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository contains only a single local branch. This branch is called a \"master\" branch. It means that \"master\" is a repository's \"default\" branch.<p>\n",

    "    <p>The term Pull is used to receive data from GitHub. It fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory. The <b>git pull</b> command is used to make a Git pull. Pull requests are a process for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their remote server account. Pull request announces all the team members that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch.<p>\n",

    "    <p>In Git, the term remote is concerned with the remote repository. It is a shared repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. A remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like an internal server, GitHub, Subversion and more. In case of a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state, as an alternative it only consists of the .git versioning data.<p>\n",

    "    <p>In Git, Repository is like a data structure used by VCS to store metadata for a set of files and directories.
